Hi! :)

Here's my simple Warships console game, hope you like it!

It has some obvious shortcomings, like not all classes are covered by tests but also there's no DI or interfaces and there's rarely any project structure.

I decided to go with such solution because it's a very small project and I'm quite time-conscious, but I will gladly talk about all these aspects during the interview :)

Hope you understand these decisions :) And I wish you good look, fellow pirate!

# How to run it:

1. make sure you've got .Net 6 or later on your machine
2. open GameOfBattleships.sln in your Visual Studio or other editor
3. run GameOfBattleships project - voila! It should work just fine :)
